# hello-world
This is a test creation of a Repository to get a better feel for using Github and creating Repos
Hi world! My name is Maher, and I'm a recent computer programmer in the University of Texas Computer Science Honors program
I originally studied Neuroscientist, but I realized that I only had a specific interest in that field (Namely, how vision works)
so I decided to pursue Computer Science and simply minor in Neuroscience to study the things I really care about. 
How the brain, and how Computers work are incredibly similar and when it comes to Computer Vision, an area of research that I was basically born for, I can't help but get incredibly excited like I was back in my childhood. 

Anyways, this is a test repo, if you're reading this. Thank you.
